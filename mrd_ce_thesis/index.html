<blockquote>
<p>Frost heave is typically associated with the formation of segregation ice in
fine-grained soil. Coarse-grained soil is generally considered to be non-frost
susceptible. Field observations and laboratory experiments show that
coarse-grained soil can be extremely ice-rich in specific conditions. Previous
studies have shown that oscillation of the frozen-unfrozen boundary can lead to
the formation of ice by a mechanism different from the segregation ice
mechanism. Conditions related to the formation of ice in coarse-grained soil
were investigated using modern laboratory techniques. Fourteen tests were
conducted on five soil types. The thickness of soil subjected to freeze-thaw
cycles was varied and controlled by the magnitude and duration of applied soil
temperatures. The thickness of the ice formed increased when the sample
drainage was limited or prevented during cooling. Under specific conditions,
the formation of a discrete ice layer was observed in coarse-grained soils.
Seven samples were scanned with the Î¼CT scanner at the completion of the
warming and cooling tests. The sub-samples scanned were analyzed in 2D
cross-sections, and characterized as 3D reconstructions. Frost heave induced
by the formation of ice was observed in both fine- and coarse-grained soils,
including soils that were found to be traditionally non-frost susceptible.</p>
