### Abstract

> Frost heave is typically associated with the formation of segregation ice in
> fine-grained soil. Coarse-grained soil is generally considered to be non-frost
> susceptible. Field observations and laboratory experiments show that
> coarse-grained soil can be extremely ice-rich in specific conditions. Previous
> studies have shown that oscillation of the frozen-unfrozen boundary can lead to
> the formation of ice by a mechanism different from the segregation ice
> mechanism. Conditions related to the formation of ice in coarse-grained soil
> were investigated using modern laboratory techniques. Fourteen tests were
> conducted on five soil types. The thickness of soil subjected to freeze-thaw
> cycles was varied and controlled by the magnitude and duration of applied soil
> temperatures. The thickness of the ice formed increased when the sample
> drainage was limited or prevented during cooling. Under specific conditions,
> the formation of a discrete ice layer was observed in coarse-grained soils.
> Seven samples were scanned with the Î¼CT scanner at the completion of the
> warming and cooling tests. The sub-samples scanned were analyzed in 2D
> cross-sections, and characterized as 3D reconstructions. Frost heave induced
> by the formation of ice was observed in both fine- and coarse-grained soils,
> including soils that were found to be traditionally non-frost susceptible.
